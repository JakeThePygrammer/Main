        <h3>Our city</h3>
            <p>MSG, the capital of the country of MSG, is located in the Osoj river basin, with a temperate climate, with<br>
                long summers and short winters. The mountains around MSG are ideal for skiing. The first settlements in MSG <br>
                were over 3000 years ago, making it an archaeological hotspot. MSG has gone through a complex history, with many<br>
                historical events.</p>
            <p>Most of MSG was constructed after WW2, after nazi occupation ended. MSG was successfully freed by general Jakov on 29th of November 1945.<br>
                MSG then switched to a socialist way of government, with rapid construction and modernization of the city. Now, MSG is a large industrial and<br>
                commercial hub, with rapid growth.</p>
